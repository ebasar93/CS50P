if s is a str, you could print each of its characters, one at a time, with code like:

for c in s:
    print(c, end="")



De Morgan's Law. (not A) and (not B) is equivalent to not (A or B), and (not A) or (not B) is equivalent to not (A and B).

print(f"x is {x}")
Notice that by including the f, we tell Python to interpolate what is in the curly braces as the value of x.

 For best practice, we should only try the fewest lines of code possible that we are concerned could fail.
