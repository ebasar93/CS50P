This project is a unique timer application with a twist. It’s not just a simple countdown timer, but it also incorporates a random element that gives it a game-like feel. The timer is designed to act as a productivity tool, where the user sets a time for focused work. Upon completion of the timer, there’s a fifty-fifty chance that the timer will restart. This element of unpredictability serves as a reward mechanism, where the user is either rewarded with a break or challenged to continue their productive work for another cycle.

The project utilizes two key Python modules: the Random module and the Tkinter library. The Random module is used to simulate a coin flip, providing an unbiased decision on whether the timer should restart or not. The Tkinter library, on the other hand, is used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for the project, making it user-friendly and easy to interact with.

## Features

The timer application has several features:

Start: This feature allows the user to start the countdown timer. The countdown is based on the input given in minutes by the user.

Pause/Resume: This feature gives the user control over the timer. It allows the user to pause the countdown timer when it’s running, and resume the countdown from where it left off when it was paused.

Reset: This feature allows the user to reset the countdown timer to 00:00, providing a fresh start whenever needed.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script.

2. Enter the time in minutes in the input field.

3. Click the "Start" button to start the countdown timer.

4. Click the "Pause/Resume" button to pause or resume the countdown timer.

5. Click the "Reset" button to reset the countdown timer to 00:00.

## Requirements

The requirements for running this application are Python 3 and the Tkinter library. Python 3 is the programming language used to write the script, and Tkinter is a Python library for creating GUIs. Both are essential for running this application.

This project is a fun and innovative way to manage time and increase productivity. It combines the seriousness of time management with the unpredictability of a game, making productivity fun!
